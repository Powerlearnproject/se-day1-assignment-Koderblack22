This change is leading to new development practices, tools, and applications that leverage AI for better decision-making and efficiency in software development processes.

4. Cloud Computing and Microservices Architecture (2010s-Present): The rise of cloud computing has drastically changed how software is deployed and maintained. Microservices architecture, which decomposes applications into small, independent services, allows for greater scalability and resilience. This architecture has become a standard practice for building modern software applications.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**Ans**
1. Planning: In this initial phase, the project goals, scope, and feasibility are defined. Stakeholders discuss requirements, allocate resources, and create a project timeline. This phase lays the foundation for the entire development process.

2. Requirements Analysis: During this phase, detailed requirements are gathered and documented. Stakeholders' needs are studied to create a clear understanding of what the software should accomplish, resulting in a specification document that outlines all functional and non-functional requirements.

3. Design: The design phase involves creating the architecture of the software. Developers outline how the software will be structured, including user interface design, system interfaces, and data structures. This phase results in design specifications and models that guide coding.

4. Implementation (Coding): In this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. The implementation involves translating design documents into code using appropriate programming languages and tools, while also adhering to coding standards and practices.

5. Testing: Once the software is developed, it undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix defects. Various testing methods, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing, are employed to ensure the software meets the specified requirements.

6. Deployment: After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment. This phase involves installing the software for users, configuring the system, and ensuring everything operates as intended. It may also involve training users and providing documentation.

7. Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is updated and improved based on user feedback and changing requirements. This phase includes bug fixes, enhancements, and the implementation of new features to ensure the software remains relevant and functional.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

**Ans**
Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies

Waterfall Methodology:

Definition: 
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before the next begins.

Phases: 
Includes stages like Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.
